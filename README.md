<h1>Designing a Minimalist Business Card Site for a Decor Service</h1>
<p>For this minimalist website, I based my design on a description of a potential customer’s business goal and built it from scratch using only HTML and CSS.</p>

<h2>Brief</h2>

- Small business
- Luxury feel but low budget
- A mix between cleaning service and interior desing
- Inspired by Marie Kondo

<h2>From Research to Minimum Viable Product</h2>

<b>Research</b>. I looked at websites from similar companies as well as competitors. During research, I learned that cleaning service-style websites generally look cluttered (which is ironic). Also, high scale websites favor minimal design and are more like appetizers—they expect customers to ask for more information after first glance.

<b>Feedback</b>. I initially e-mailed the client and then asked my team (students like me) for feedback on the early design choices. Everything from the font, layout, to the code itself are still a big question mark. What matters at this stage is identifying an initial direction and adjusting along the way to stay goal-driven.</p>

<b>Branding</b>. I made a simple mood board/style tile to start the conversation on look and feel. A lot changed in the end but a few things stayed the same. The left-alignment of the text and the text hierarchy became part of the website’s core structure. However, the colors changed to be more clean and allow space for the images to shine.

<p>
<b>Prototype</b>. I created a mockup in CodePen to begin testing. I constantly asked myself: does it break? Is it behaving as expected? A few issues came up quickly, mainly that images and text had to be adjusted for different screen sizes with a @media query. Based on feedback, I also remade the mobile version to keep a sense of cleanliness and space.
